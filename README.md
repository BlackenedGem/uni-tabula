## About
This is a basic implementation of the Roman game of Tabula. As well as supporting human players the game also has computer players.
A human player can play against a computer player, or you could even have computer player vs computer player.
The computer players were created by experimentation and then playing them against themselves. By running thousands of games we can determine whether an improvement has been made.

## Usage
The game can either be compiled from sources, or run using the contents of `compiled`. The game runs by default in GUI mode, but also has a console interface.
Text scaling support might not be great as this was created a few years ago with less consideration for scaling (and JavaFX has improved support since then).
However resizing of the UI should work well due to how javafx supports adaptive layouts.
